0.1.2 2011-04-24T13:33:38Z
 [Dependencies::Noteworthy]

 [Dependencies::Stats]

 [Internals]
 - Redundant code that handled <=0.14 versions removed as 0.17 is now a mandatory pre-requisite.

 - Updated NEXT token extra whitespace test to adapt to changes in CPAN::Changes 0.17

 [Utils::Internals]
 - normalize.pl now uses CPAN::Changes 0.17 instead of hacking the output manually.

0.1.1 2011-04-17T00:38:07Z
 [BugFix]
 - Depend on CPAN::Changes version 0.16 which exposes the regex we consume.

   CPAN::Changes to tidy it, both reading Changes and writing Changes.out

0.1.0 2011-04-13T20:36:43Z

 - Does Self-Testing for now with a hard-coded example script.
