Release history for Test-CPAN-Changes-ReallyStrict

0.1.3 2011-04-24T13:37:34Z
 - No changes, just this time hopefully the twitter plugin will work
   because  I actually have LWP::Protocol::https installed.

0.1.2 2011-04-24T13:33:38Z
 [Dependencies]
 - Depend on Version 0.17 which contains the surplus whitespace fix.

 [Internals]
 - Redundant code that handled <=0.14 versions removed as 0.17 is now a
   mandatory pre-requisite.

 [Tests]
 - Updated NEXT token extra whitespace test to adapt to changes in
   CPAN::Changes 0.17

 [Utils::Internals]
 - normalize.pl now uses CPAN::Changes 0.17 instead of hacking the output
   manually.

0.1.1 2011-04-17T00:38:07Z
 [BugFix]
 - Depend on CPAN::Changes version 0.16 which exposes the regex we consume.

 [Dependencies]
 - CPAN::Changes now version 0.16 ( 0.160.0 )

 [Features]
 - Add utils for migrating/tidying Changes files. zuluize.pl
   de-dist-zilla-izes it, and normalize runs it through CPAN::Changes to
   tidy it, both reading Changes and writing Changes.out

0.1.0 2011-04-13T20:36:43Z
 - First version.
 - Does Self-Testing for now with a hard-coded example script.
