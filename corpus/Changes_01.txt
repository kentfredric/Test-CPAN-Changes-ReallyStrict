 [Dependencies]
 - Removed Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CPANChangesTests
 - Added Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::CPAN::Changes

 [Features]
 - Replace CPANChangesTests with Test::CPAN::Changes

1.0.5 2011-04-03T15:21:54Z
 [Features]
 - Can now pass 'auto_prereqs_skip' instead of having to filter the bundle
   and mangle things.
 - Newly Minted Changes file is more formal and CPAN::Changes-like.

 [Packaging]
 - Now comes with utils/zuluize.pl to translate Dist::Zilla style
   datestamps to W3CDTF while retaining accuracy.

   CPAN::Changes and normalize the output.

 [Dependencies]
 - Moved dependency on CompileTests plugin from 1.101800 to 1.110930 to
   avoid rt#67183

   shipped in the ShareDir for this module name.
 - Consuming dists can now set 'git_versions = 1' as a flag to this plugin
   to use Git::NextVersion instead of AutoVersion::Relative.
 - Now ship .perltidyrc files with all dists by adding an exclusion to
   PruneCruft/GatherDir. Have to drop portability tests as a result.
